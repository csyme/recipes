Ingredients
Cream Cheese Filling Version
12 jalapeño peppers*
1/4 cup minced onion
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
3/4 cup cream cheese
1 1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon salt (more or less to taste)
2 ounces jack cheese, cut into 2 1/2-inch long batons
Bacon and Jack Cheese Filling Version
12 jalapeño peppers*
1/4 cup chopped cooked bacon
1/4 cup minced onion
1/2 cup shredded jack cheese, plus another 2 ounces of jack cheese cut into 2 1/2-inch long batons
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon dried oregano
* When buying jalapeños for this recipe, if you want mild peppers, look for peppers with smooth skins. Striations tend to indicate that the pepper has been stressed while growing, and that can mean a hotter pepper.
Method
1 Preheat the oven to 375°.
2 You can either slice the jalapeños in half lengthwise or you can slice off the top one-third (lengthwise) of each jalapeño to make a boat shape out of each pepper. The halved jalapeños will go further (twice as many stuffed peppers), but you can put more filling into the boat-shaped peppers. Your choice. If you choose to make the boats, you can mince the tops and add them to the filling if you want some extra heat, or save them for another recipe. Scrape out all the seeds and ribs from each jalapeño with a spoon (a grapefruit spoon works great).
3 Mix together all the filling ingredients except the jack cheese batons.
4 Pack the filling into the peppers and nestle a baton of jack cheese onto the filling of each one. Arrange the peppers on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake for 20-30 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned, and the peppers are cooked.
Allow to cool for 5 minutes before serving.
